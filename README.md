# Satellite Situation - a js13k game entry

Satellite Situation is a browser game developed for the 2021 [js13kGames](https://js13kgames.com/) competition. The 2021 theme was `Space`

In this game you control a spaceship that has to deliver some satellites to planets, but every time a satellite is located you have less space to locate the remaining satellites.

To win the game you must locate all the satellites safely without any of them colliding with an already placed one.

### Controls
> A/D keys or Left/Right arrows -> Move spaceship

> Spacebar -> Shoot satellite to planet

### Asset size
To participate in the js13kGames competition all game entries must weight 13Kb or less, so the size is very important in this project. The minified game submitted for the jam is located into the `minified` folder and has the following files:

> index.html -> 7.36Kb

> sprite.png -> 5.27Kb

> Total size -> 12.6Kb

### Application run instructions
To run the game you must download the project and open the `index.html` file located in the root folder, that's it!

If you want to run the minified version, the corresponding `index.html` file is located inside the `minified` folder, but the game is exactly the same that in the normal version.
